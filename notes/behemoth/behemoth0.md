# behemoth0

Each level in behemoth consists of an exploitable executable.

## Analysis

As always, we start with `strings`! Running `strings /behemoth/behemoth0` shows us nothing particularly exciting apart from:
```
unixisbetterthanwindows
followthewhiterabbit
pacmanishighoncrack
```

Is one of these the password? Apparently not.
