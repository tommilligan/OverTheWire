XOR is vulnerable to multiple message decryption, as XOR is reversible.

e.g.

SECRET = 01010101

MESSG1 = 11110000
MESSG2 = 00001111

CIPHR = SECRET XOR MESSG

CIPHR1 = 10100101
CIPHR2 = 01011010

CIPHRX = CIPHR1 XOR CIPHR2

CIPHRX = 11111111

Crib guess MESSG1 = 11??????
XOR with CIPHRX= 00??????
From the response I guess my crib is right, then try to extend it


Caeser cipher?

ABCDEF
FBEDAC

SECRET = FBEDAC

MESSG1 = DEFACE
MESSG2 = BEEFED

CIPHR1 = DACFEA
CIPHR2 = BAACAF

CIPHRX = not possible

but, crib method can still be used!
as letters are mapped 1:1, we can use other messages to independantly check a crib guess

I guess MESSG2 = BEEF??

therefor, cipher is

?B??EF
?B??AC

this would make MESSG1 = ?EFA?E

if this looks good, we accept the crib, repeat to extend
